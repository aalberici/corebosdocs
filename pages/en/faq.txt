!!! I'm not too sure this is very useful. I think it is much better to track your visitor with [[http://www.google.com/analytics/index.html|Google Analytics]] or [[http://piwik.org/|PiWik]] (which is what we usually do), but it should be rather easy to accomplish:

  * create a custom field in CRM
  * in the form create a hidden field for that custom field and fill it in with the _SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] value

that's it.
